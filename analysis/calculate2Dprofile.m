function calculate2Dprofile(normalAxis, xAxis ,bin,crop,atoms,allAtoms)
%calculates 2D concentration profile of 'atoms' compared to 'allAtoms'. If
%'allAtoms' is not parsed, raw counts will be used. 'crop' is a [min max]
%limit for the 2D profile. The 'normalAxis' also defines the origin of the
%2D concentration profile.

% transform atoms into the coordinate system of the 2D conc profile
