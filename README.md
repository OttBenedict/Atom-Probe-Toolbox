# Atom Probe Toolbox
 Matlab toolbox for APT analysis

 This toolbox covers mutliple possibilities to analyse atom probe datasets.
 Starting point is a .pos or .epos file. These main analysis methods are covered:
 - Create a mass spectrum and range ions
 - 3D plot of your point cloud data
 - Select regions of interest as a cylinder/sphere/box/plane and perform analysis
 - Concentration calculation
 - Grain boundary analysis
 - Cluster Analysis
 - interfacial Excess
 - Isosurface analysis
 - Correct the distortions introduced by the Reflectron
 - Create one HDF5 format for your measurement and add meta data
 - Analyse an HDF5 database filled with APT datasets

# How to use the atom probe
- You can download the repository from GitHub to your computer and add the repository to your active folder in Matlab
- You can download the packed toolbox and install it to your Matlab version

# First start
In the folder doc is a Getting started guide with a description of each workflow and function. 
A good start is the Workflow_FirstSteps.mlx
For a visual introduction, on youtube are some tutorial videos on the channel of Peter Felfer:
