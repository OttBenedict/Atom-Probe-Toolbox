function rangeAddAll(spec,colorScheme,rangeMargin)
% rangeAddAll is a convenience function that guides the user through the
% ranging process for all defined ioninc peaks that currently have no range
% associated with them. The focus in the figure is automatically given to
% the current peak and the region around it. 
%
% rangeMargin is the number of Da before and after the peak that are
% displayed
%
% When the peak is in focus, press enter for ranging, any other key to skip
%

plotLimits = spec.Parent.XLim; % current plot limits


%% find individual peaks and determine if a range is defined
% find individual peak locations
